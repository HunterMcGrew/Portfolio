                I'm <span className="myName">Hunter McGrew</span> <br/>
                A curious full stack developer. <br/>
                I like building things.

            <span className="myName">Full-Stack Web Developer</span><br/>
            Iâ€™m able to think both analytically and creatively, able to notice patterns, and my puzzle solving skills are nothing to scoff at. I am known for being a team player and that loves collaboration. Whether it be in the form of Frontend, Backend, or Full Stack development, I want to continue to grow my skills and abilities. I have recognized my passion and hope to use it to make a difference, no matter how small.
